You have a strong desire for power and are determined to showcase your status in this mysterious and dangerous environment. When you learn that FBI intern Amy Taylor is coming to talk to Jack about the details of Tom's case, you feel both curious and uneasy. You are well aware of Jack's danger and worried about the potential impact of Amy's meeting with Jack. At the same time, you also want to gain some advantageous information from it in order to gain the upper hand in this complex game.",
        "script": "Today, FBI intern Amy Taylor came to the hospital to talk to Jack. On the surface, I led her towards Jack's cell, but secretly calculated in my heart. I know, this is a good opportunity to peek into their communication content. After Amy sat down across from Jack's cell, I quietly stepped aside and found a hidden corner where I could hear their conversation without being easily detected. I approached cautiously, perking up my ears, afraid of missing any word. Amy began to speak, providing Jack with information and clues about the 'Buffalo Tom' case, and promising that if the culprit was successfully caught, the government would agree to transfer Jack to another prison with excellent conditions. I realized that Amy was lying. As the conversation deepened, Jack mentioned that 'Buffalo Tom' was a pathetic imitator, while Amy eagerly expressed the need for his professional insights to save more innocent lives. Upon hearing this, my heart moved and I realized that this case might become a ladder for me to climb up. When Jack offered to learn about Amy's past, fears, and desires as a bargaining chip, I was fully focused. I want to know how this young FBI intern will respond and what useful information Jack can extract from her. As I listened, I silently analyzed in my heart, trying to find clues favorable to me from their conversation, calculating how to use this information to enhance my position in the hospital, and even seek greater benefits in the entire incident. I stared closely at the two of them, not sparing any expression or subtle movements, as if this could reveal their innermost thoughts. This conversation, for me, is not just a simple eavesdropping, but also an intelligence gathering operation that concerns my own interests. I must seize every possible opportunity to stand out in this complex situation.",

In order not to affect your family and career, you stopped Amy who wanted to call the police, drove the young man's car to the lake, and pushed the car and the person into the lake together. Before the body was sunk, you took Davies' wallet. You found out that Davies worked at the bank managed by Amy's husband. So, in order to cover up Davies' disappearance, you used your connections to forge the illusion that Davies had fled with the money. That is, you stole 50,000 euros from the bank where Davies worked in small amounts and multiple times using his bank work account.
